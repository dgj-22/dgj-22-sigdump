# DGJ-22
## Mission
In a time of uncertainty and conflict, what can an individual with no real political power nor riches do? This was the question we asked ourselves when trying to find someway to not be another passive observer to the crisis in the world. With just a few of us on Clubhouse, we decided to simply record and translate live civilian, unencrypted shortwave radio near Russia and Ukraine over the internet just to gather better insight into what is actually happening as impartial observers. Now, a movement is beginning where others who feel similarly are gathering in order to build and maintain a historical record, educate others on how to verify information they see from 3rd party sources, and humanize the voices who are involved. Our philiosophy is to **let the data lead the way**.

## Vision
Within the first week of starting this project, someone came into our Clubhouse room of 30-40 people with a newly viral YouTube video they claimed to be evidence of a nuclear bomb explosion in Ukraine. The energy in the room immediately dropped as people started to fear the worst. Instead of letting our emotions plague our better judgement, some of us used the internet radio tools we had in front us to verify the dreadful claim. 

First, we checked to see if we can still connect to the radios near Ukraine over the internet. Yes, we could. 

Second, we looked at the RF spectrum monitor to see if there are any anomalies. No, there were not. 

Lastly, we tuned in a few voice channels and had the Russian speakers translate. No, no one was talking about a nuke. After calmly explaining the strong evidence we observed from the raw data we collected online, the room filled with silence of relief. Everyone was fully convinced that the viral video was highly implausible. **Where can we find this kind of data on news media today?** 

**Our long-term vision is to develop an accessible decentralized platform of raw data collection with powerful open-source modeling tools that the general public can easily use to discover truth via their own experimentation and investigation.**
