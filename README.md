# Monitoring, Archiving and Transcribing Open Civilian Russian Radio Communications During the Ukraine Russia War
You will find in this [repository](https://github.com/dgj-22/dgj-22-sigdump) audio recordings and transcripts of open Russian radio communications collected from 3/1/22 to 3/6/22. Locations include Lipetsk, Rossosh, Crimea and Moscow. We are continuously recording. Please join our diverse team as we work to make sense out of what is going on in Ukraine and Russia during a time of uncertainty. 

Check out the first transcription [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dgj-22/dgj-22-sigdump/main/Transcriptions/Dump%201.1/1.1%20DGJ-22%20English.pdf).

## Mission
In a time of uncertainty and conflict, what can an individual with no real political power nor riches do? This was the question we asked ourselves when trying to find some way to not be another passive observer to the crisis in the world. With just a few of us on Clubhouse, we decided to simply record and translate live civilian, unencrypted shortwave radio near Russia and Ukraine over the internet just to gather better insight into what is actually happening. Now, a varied group of volunteers from all over the world have come together in order to build and maintain a historical record, educate others on how to verify information they see from 3rd party sources, and humanize the voices who are involved. Our philosophy is to **let the data lead the way**.

---
## Vision
Our vision is to develop an accessible, decentralized platform for raw data collection using open-source tools and methods that the general public can then utilize to gather, analyze, and archive unfiltered, first hand accounts of people and events in areas of interest, such as active war zones.

## Why this matters?:
Within the first week of starting this project, someone came into our Clubhouse room of 30-40 people with a newly viral YouTube video they claimed to be evidence of a nuclear bomb explosion in Ukraine. The emotions in the room immediately dropped as people started to fear the worst. Instead of letting our feelings plague our better judgment, some of us used the internet radio tools we had in front us to verify the dreadful claim.

First, we checked to see if we can still connect to the radios near Ukraine over the internet. Yes, we could.

Second, we looked at the RF spectrum monitor to see if there were any anomalies. No, there were not.

Lastly, we tuned in a few voice channels and had the Russian speakers with us translate. No, no one was talking about a nuke. 

After explaining the strong evidence we observed from the raw data we collected online, the room filled with silence of relief. Everyone was fully convinced that the viral video was highly implausible. Where can we find this kind of data in the news media today?

## FAQ
**Q:** Are we hacking the Russians?
**A:** No.

**Q:** Who's side are you on?
**A:** The side of peace.

**Q:** Is it illegal to listen to certain radio frequencies?
**A:** Maybe. Refer to your country's wireless communication laws.

**Q:** What's the short term priority of this project?
**A:** Record and archive as much civilian shortwave radio communications near Ukraine and Russia as possible.

**Q:** Is this dangerous?
**A:** Most of us see this project as a net-positive to humanity; howerver, there exists concern for bad parties clipping audio out of context and using it for pro-war propaganda. We are taking privacy and security seriously.

**Q:** Are we doing the same thing as Shadowbreak and URW?
**A:** We certainly overlap; however, we have more of a focus on archiving civilian radio communications. We also think it's a good thing for as many people to duplicate this effort to figure out what's happening.

**Q:** What is WebSDR?
**A:** It is a website that can connect you to various different radios around the world for you to listen to.

**Q:** Who are we listening to?
**A:** Mostly Russian civilians.

**Q:** Do I have to speak Russian?
**A:** No. Most of us don't and use online translations tools.

**Q:** How can I help?
**A:** Visit our Discord and Element Channels found here: [https://linktr.ee/gflx_dgj_22](https://linktr.ee/gflx_dgj_22)
