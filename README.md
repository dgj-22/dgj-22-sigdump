# Monitoring, Archiving and Transcribing Open Russian Radio Communications During the Ukraine Russia War

You will find in this repository audio recordings and transcripts of open Russian radio communications collected from 3/1/22 to now. Locations include Lipetsk, Rossosh, Crimea and Moscow. We are updating as we collect more recordings. Please join our team of radio operators, recorders and engineers working to make sense out of what is going on in Ukraine and Russia during a time of propoganda and censorship. We currently need radio watchers, recorders, translators, transcribers, software engineers, data scientists, language analysts and more.
